In his new role, Pascual is responsible for supporting technical sales efforts throughout North America, contributing to marketing and product development initiatives and training and assisting our sales channel partners. With extended experience and knowledge in flow measurement and control applications, Pascual will undoubtedly play a key role as we continue to strengthen our Flow Instrumentation business.
