The EyeOnWater Consumer App for Android is Now Available in the Google Play Store!


The EyeOnWater consumer app for Android is now available for download in the Google play store. The EyeOnWater app gives end water consumers direct access to their own water usage data and provides tools to help manage water usage. The app in the Google Play store is compatible for use with Android phones and phone/tablet hybrids up to 480 ppi.


The EyeOnWater app for Android includes:

Graphs showing recent usage, with a comparison against average usage
A graph showing usage trends
A leak alert

To demonstrate and promote the EyeOnWater consumer app, Badger Meter direct and distributor sales representatives can download the app to an Android phone or phone/tablet hybrid and select the ‘Demo’ link at the bottom of the sign-in screen. The demo account can be used at any time to demonstrate the power behind the proactive information that BEACON AMA and EyeOnWater provide.


For utilities and end water consumers with a BEACON AMA deployment, additional information is required to register an account. Information to get started was recently posted to the Badger Meter Extranet in Word and PDF format in the Customer Facing Documents section. Please share this information with utilities to help them get their end water consumers registered to use the EyeOnWater consumer app to manage their usage.


Additional functionality for the Android app is under development with an anticipated release of charting of historical usage by the end of November. An app for use with Apple (iOS) devices was released in September and was announced in the September 16th eNews.


Please contact Kristie Anderson if you have any questions.
