A new case study for Beauregard Parish, Louisiana is now available on the Badger Meter website and extranet. Beauregard Parish began as a BEACON AMA starter kit sale, sold by Central Pipe and Supply, Inc., and then easily transitioned to a full BEACON AMA managed solution depolyment. Beauregard Parish explains how their installation of new E-Series® Ultrasonic meters, ORION Cellular endpoints and the BEACON AMA software suite helped to increase efficiency, enhance customer service, and save time and money.

Smart Water Study


Sponsored by Badger Meter, Zpryme and the Smart Water Summit (SWS) completed a smart water survey of 75 U.S. utilities and found that cost poses the most significant challenge for smart water initiatives. Despite challenges with cost, many water utilities are beginning to embrace smart water technologies, including smart metering as well as analytics.


Some of the positive key take-aways from the report for our smart water products include:

Nine out of ten water utilities have a smart water plan.
The focus now is on smart meters and billing, but those capabilities will expand as utilities gain more experience with smart water technologies.
Cost is the top concern for smart water efforts, but the challenges are more than financing, including cyber-security and lack of qualified staff.
Many water utilities have technology skill gaps in their workforce but do not plan to hire technology staff in the next year. This creates opportunities to train existing staff or to work more with third-party providers that can provide technology expertise.
