Kynar RCV Valve Controls Chemical Dosing in
Water Treatment
A municipal agency in Alameda County, California needed to eliminate pathogens during water treatment using sodium hypochlorite. Since sodium hypochlorite is a very corrosive chemical, the utility needed to find a dosing solution that could withstand the corrosion.
The utility installed a gravity-fed system using a Kynar Research Control Valve to control the chemical dosing. Kynar is impervious to corrosion and the valve is able to automatically compensate for line pressure changes that occur as the level in the chemical tank falls. The Kynar Research Control Valve allows the utility to dispense an accurate dosage, resulting in controlled raw material costs and regulation compliance. Maintenance and downtime are minimal due to the high chemical resistance of Kynar.
The Kynar PVDF Plastic Control Valve for Corrosive Service is available in 1/4-inch, 1/2-inch, 3/4-inch and 1-inch sizes. Its compact design and light weight make it especially suited for modulating control of low to medium flow rates.
